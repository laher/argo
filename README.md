ar-go
=====

Support for .ar archives in Go.

This library was modelled after Go's own `archive/tar` library, so the code & example resembles it closely. I have included Go's copyright and used a similar BSD-style licence.

Please see [godoc for documentation](http://godoc.org/github.com/laher/argo/ar), [including an example](http://godoc.org/github.com/laher/argo/ar#example-package)
